1.Statement Coverage: Statement coverage is to execute all statements at least once. Hence, each
line of code is tested. In the case of a flowchart, every node must be checked at least once. 


2.Branch Coverage: 
Branch coverage focuses on testing the decision points or conditional branches in the
code. 
It checks whether both possible outcomes (true and false) of each conditional statement are tested.
 
Here test cases are designed so that each branch from all decision points is traversed at least
once. 

3.Conditional Coverage:all individual conditions must be covered.

Condition coverage ensures that each individual condition in a decision 


4.Path Coverage: Covers all possible execution paths through the code.

5. In this technique, all the possible combinations of the possible outcomes
of conditions are tested at least once.

6. Basis Path Testing: In this technique, control flow graphs are made from code or flowchart and then
Cyclomatic complexity is calculated which defines the number of independent paths so that the minimal
number of test cases can be designed for each independent path.

7. Loop Testing: Loops are widely used and these are fundamental to many algorithms hence, their testing
is very important. Errors often occur at the beginnings and ends of loops.

Nested loops: 
In nested loops, all the loops are set to their minimum count, and we start from the
inner loop. Simple loop tests are conducted for the innermost loop and this is worked outwards till all
the loops have been tested.

Concatenated loops: All loops are tested separately one after the other.Simple loop tests are applied for each. If they’re
not independent, treat them like nesting.
